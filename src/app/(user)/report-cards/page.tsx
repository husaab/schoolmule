// next is report card generation, basically, im thinking like a ui in which there is main check boxes one could select

// Generate Report cards for all grades

// Generate report cards for (dropdown) grade selected)

// then generate report cards for specific students , in which there will be a list of students similar to general attendance, ordered by grade , and collapsable grade headers, and a checkbox that says generate

// and thne at the bottom it will be a button saying, generate report cards, in which when pressed we will have a modal pop up with the loading screen that isnt closable, and when finally everything loads, we sy "your report cards have been successfully generated and saved to (idk well talk about where to save them)" and then the user can exit
